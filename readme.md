## a basic word application for computational linguistics class
> We are introduced to the basics of python in this class. Our instructor wanted us to make use of what we learned in the class.
> We were asked to assign a variable that is normally a static one. I turned it into dynamic one where you enter whatever you want and, it returns the result according to what you've entered.
> I use TKinter to create a basic UI for the app.
